Fluids 1 
  First CPU version, 2007
  Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)

Fluids 2
  First GPU version, 2011
  Radix-sort based (using Simon Green, 2010)
  CPU-GPU transfers per frame (pipeline bottleneck)

Fluids 3.0 
  Major update, 2012
  New Insertion-sort based
  Entirely on GPU
  Explicit memory allocs
  Cuda Run-time API (cudaLaunchKernel)
  Static/mixed host code (fluid_system_host.cu)
  3rd party Prefix scan
  Fluid as struct (AofS)
  Kernels: insertParticles, countingSort, computePressure, computeForce, advanceParticles
  Introduced insertion-sort and prefix scan, as faster alternatives to radix-sort for particle search
  GTC 2014 Talk - Fast Fixed-Radius Nearest Neighbors: Interactive Million Particle Fluids

Fluids 3.2
  Minor update, 2013
  Application code (abstracted main)
  GUI added
  Still using Cuda Run-time API (cudaLaunchKernel)
  Identical kernels to 3.0

Fluids 3.9
  Major update, 2021
  Cuda Driver API (cuLaunchKernel)
  Large-scale prefix sums, custom code, >4 mil particles
  Allocation helper, cpu & gpu (AllocateBuffer)
  Source at top level

Fluids 4.0
  Rewrite, 2022
  Fluid struct removed
  Fluid as buffers (SofA, see fluid.h)
  Buffer-based kernels
  Allows for arbitrary per-particle properties
  New kernels: sampleParticles, computeQuery
  Write to disk (SavePoints)
  Equivalent CPU code
  Run modes: SEARCH, CPU_SLOW, CPU_GRID, VALIDATE, GPU_FULL, PLAYBACK

Fluids 5.0
  Modernized, 2023
  Cuda Driver API (cuLaunchKernel)
  Large-scale prefixSums, custom code, >1 mil particles
  Full Smart Pointers, cpu & gpu (DataPtr)
  Buffer-based kernels
  Abstract Buffer management (DataX)
  Removed run modes
  Integrated CPU/GPU switching per func (instead of run modes)
  Modern folder struct (src, assets)
  Major code cleanup and reduction
