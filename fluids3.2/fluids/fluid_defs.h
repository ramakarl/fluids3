 Notes on Clause 4:
  The intent of this clause is public attribution for this contribution, not code use restriction. 
  Both commerical and open source projects may redistribute and reuse without code release.
  However, clause #1 of ZLib indicates that "you must not claim that you wrote the original software". 
  Clause #4 makes this more specific by requiring public acknowledgement to be extended to 
  derivative licenses.
